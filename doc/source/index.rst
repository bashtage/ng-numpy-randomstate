randomstate's documentation
===========================
This package contains a drop-in replacements for the NumPy RandomState object
that change the core random number generator.

What's New or Different
=======================
* ``random_uintegers`` produces either 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integers.
  These are at thte core of most PRNGs and so they are directly exposed.
* ``randomstate.entropy.random_entropy`` provides access to the system
  source of randomness that is used in cryptographic applications (e.g.,
  ``/dev/urandom`` on Unix).
* The normal generator supports a 256-step ziggurat method which is 2-6 times
  faster than NumPy's ``standard_normal``.  This generator can be accessed using

.. code-block:: python

  from randomstate import standard_normal
  standard_normal(100000, method='zig')


Supported Generators
====================
The main innovation is the includion of a number of alterntive pseudo random number
generators, 'in addition' to the standard PRNG in NumPy.  The included PRNGs are:

* MT19937 - The standard NumPy generator.  Produces identical results to NumPy
  using the same seed/state. See `NumPy's documentation`_.
* dSFMT - A SSE2 enables version of the MT19937 generator.  Theoretically the
  same, but with a different state and so it is not possible to produce an
  sequence identical to MT19937. See the `dSFMT authors' page`_.
* XorShit128+ and XorShift1024* - Vast fast generators based on the XSadd
  generator. These generators can be rapidly 'jumped' and so can be used in
  parallel applications. See the documentation for
  :meth:`randomstate.prng.xorshift1024.jump` for details. More information
  about these PRNGs is available at the `xorshift authors' page`_.
* PCG-32 and PCG-64 - Fast generators that support many parallel streams and
  can be advanced by an arbitrary amount. See the documentation for
  :meth:`randomstate.prng.pcg64.advance`.  PCG-32 only as a period of
  :math:`2^{64}` while PCG-64 has a period of :math:`2^{128}`. See the
  `PCG author's page`_ for more details about this class of PRNG.
* Multiplicative Lagged Fibbonacci Generator MLFG(1279, 861, \*) - A directly
  implemented multiplicative lagged fibbonacci generator with a very large
  period and good performance. Future plans include multiple stream support.
  See the `wiki page on Fibonacci generators`_.
* MRG32K3A - a classic and popular generator by L'Ecuyer. Future plans
  include multiple stream support. See the `MRG32K3A author's page`_. Lower
  performance than more modern generators.
